Sure, here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform a wireless penetration test on a WPA2 network:

1. **Preparation**: Start by setting up your tools. You'll need a wireless network adapter that supports packet injection, a Kali Linux distribution, and the necessary software such as Aircrack-ng, Reaver, and Wireshark.

2. **Information Gathering**: Use tools like airodump-ng to scan for available networks and gather information about them. This includes the BSSID (MAC address) of the target network, the channel it's operating on, and the clients connected to it.

```bash
airodump-ng wlan0
```

3. **Capture the Handshake**: Once you've identified your target network, use airodump-ng to capture the WPA handshake. This is a four-way handshake that occurs when a client connects to the network.

```bash
airodump-ng -c <channel> --bssid <BSSID> -w <output file name> wlan0
```

4. **Crack the Handshake**: After capturing the handshake, you can attempt to crack the WPA key using a tool like aircrack-ng. This process involves using a wordlist containing potential passwords.

```bash
aircrack-ng -w <wordlist> -b <BSSID> <handshake file>
```

5. **Exploiting WPS (Optional)**: If the target network has WPS enabled, you can use a tool like Reaver to brute force the WPS PIN and gain access to the network.

```bash
reaver -i wlan0 -b <BSSID> -c <channel> -vv
```

6. **Post-Exploitation**: Once you've gained access to the network, you can perform further actions such as capturing more traffic, launching attacks against other devices on the network, or even escalating your privileges on a vulnerable device.

Remember, these actions should only be performed in a legal and ethical manner, such as during a penetration test with proper authorization.
