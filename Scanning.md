Sure, here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform a wireless scan in Kali Linux:

1. **Open a Terminal**: You can do this by clicking on the Terminal icon in the taskbar or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+T`.

2. **Update Your System**: Before starting, it's a good practice to update your system to ensure you have the latest tools and security patches. Run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

3. **Install Required Tools**: There are several tools available for wireless scanning in Kali Linux. Two of the most popular ones are `aircrack-ng` and `wifite`. You can install them using the following commands:

- For aircrack-ng:

```bash
sudo apt install aircrack-ng
```

- For wifite:

```bash
sudo apt install wifite
```

4. **Perform the Scan**: Once the tools are installed, you can use them to perform a wireless scan. Here's how you can do it:

- For aircrack-ng:

```bash
sudo airmon-ng start <interface>
sudo airodump-ng <interface>mon
```

Replace `<interface>` with the name of your wireless interface. The first command puts your wireless interface into monitor mode, and the second command starts the scan.

- For wifite:

```bash
sudo wifite
```

This command starts a full wireless scan using various tools, including aircrack-ng.

Remember, these tools should be used responsibly and ethically. Always obtain proper authorization before scanning any network.
